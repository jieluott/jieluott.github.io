<p>MicroFree Technology:</p>
<p><br />
  MicroFree’s innovative product portfolio is focused on the repair and strengthening of tissue at the molecular level and is built on two core patented technologies:<br />
  Light-Activated Naphthalimides<br />
  Chitosan-based Bioadhesive<br />
These ground-breaking chemical platforms can be used alone or in combination to repair a wide range of body tissues – from arteries to corneas – and provide a complementary therapy through highly targeted localized drug delivery.</p>
<p><br />
  Elegant Simplicity<br />
  The beauty of MicroFree’s technologies lies in their simplicity…and in their elegance.<br />
Unlike stents or polymers, Alumend’s elegantly designed chemical compounds bind naturally with body tissues at the molecular level, creating a truly ‘natural’ environment.</p>
<p><br />
  MicroFreeBiotech is committed to successfully bringing these pioneering technologies from bench to bedside.</p>
